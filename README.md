# Convergence-Comparison-of-Formation-Graphs
7 different types of communication graphs are compared to evaluate their convergence duration and characteristics.
The initial conditions are kept same to evaluate them on a same level.

Some graphs show oscillation due to their directed nature before reaching the convergence value.
The star with extra edges communication graph has the most connections and is able to reach the consensus quickest.
